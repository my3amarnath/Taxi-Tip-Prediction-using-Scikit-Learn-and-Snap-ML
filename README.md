# Taxi Tip Prediction using Scikit-Learn and Snap-ML

## Introduction
This project focuses on predicting taxi tip amounts using machine learning models, specifically Decision Tree Regressors, implemented with Scikit-Learn and Snap ML. The dataset comprises information about taxi trips in New York City, and the goal is to create an accurate model to predict tip amounts.
